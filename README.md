# RMS

## Introduction
RMS, the IoT product, addresses the issue of Zoom anxiety by providing a solution for professors and speakers who struggle to gauge the emotions of their students or audience during online presentations. Many of them find it challenging to track emotional cues when presenting through platforms like Zoom or other video conferencing tools. Additionally, students often experience anxiety when seeing their own faces on the screen. 

To tackle these concerns, RMS employs real-time facial recognition technology to monitor the emotions of the audience throughout the presentation. The emotional data is then transformed into corresponding emojis, which are displayed to the presenter. This feature allows the presenter to better understand the emotional response of the audience and adapt their presentation accordingly. By providing this valuable feedback, RMS aims to alleviate Zoom anxiety and enhance the overall virtual presentation experience.

## Hint
The github repo only includes the software code which would focus on emotion recognization.
